This is a "starter pack" for OpenGL in C++.

# Prerequisites :trophy:

* Install the libraries with a package manager or software like MSYS2
* C++ environment, for example CLion or Visual Studio

# Libraries :book:
This repo comes ready with:

- GLFW
- GLEW
- GLM
- Assimp
- Freetype
- stb_image

Replacing them with alternatives shouldn't be too complicated, if you wish to go with other libraries.

# LFS-readiness :floppy_disk:

The ``.gitattributes`` file has some initial recommendations for what you can store in Git Large File Storage (LFS).
